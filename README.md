As a player aged 16+ , what I would want in a game:

### Design choices

**Colour scheme**
- The colour scheme was based on the Xbox logo because of the simplicity and because it is visually striking. 
- I also hoped to give ex-gamers a sense of nostalgia that is associated with the colour combination.

**Card images and icon**
- Simple colour combination for a nice, clear and  clean contrast.
- Images of animals used as it is neutral and caters to almost everybody. 

**Fonts**
- The primary font used in this website is *Concert one*. This was used because it has a gaming feel but at the same time, a kind of mature feel  to it.

**Gameplay**
- Initially, the number of cards were lower but was increased significantly to provide more challenge.

## Features


### Exisitng Features
1. **Screen overlay** 
- Screen overlay to show at the start of the game to explain the rules of the game. A different screen overlay will also show up during a win or a loss. 
- All overlays can be dismmised by pressing anywhere on the screen.

2. **Timer and Start button**
- Countdown timer starts when the Start button is pressed. Upon reaching zero, it will trigger the "game over" overlay.
- Designed so that the timer doesnt start and none of the cards are flippable unless the player presses the start button first.
- The start button is designed to disable itself when pressed to avoid being pressed again.

3. **Restart Button and Rules**
- Restart button reloads the page to start a new game. Can be pressed anytime so the player can restart whenever they want.
- Rules button implemented to give the player the option to view the rules again. The timer will not stop to avoid exploiting the game. 
- Rules box dismissable by clicking anywhere on "X" mark as well as anywhere on the screen for ease of use.

4. **Cards and Shuffle cards** 
- Cards are made interactive. When you hover on the back of the card, the icon will start spinning. 
- Card flip animation implemented to imitate real life card flips.
- Cards are shuffled at the start of the new game to avoid repetition. 


### Features left to implement 
1. **Restructuring of the restart button**
- At the moment, this feature is achieved by reloading the whole page. I would like to recode this in the future so that it will restart the game without having to reload the page.

2. **Adding a difficulty level**
- Add another level to the game a player can select where it will be more diffult and more challenging. Perhaps I can increase the number of the cards or decrease the timer.

3. **Scoreboard**
- I would like to add a Scoreboard so players can keep track of their games and try beat their highscores. This will add replayabilty to my game.
